    statement: `Through 15 years of working in IT, I have gained experience with a wide array of technologies - full-stack web development, cross-platform app development, game programming, and cyber security.

Besides delivering numerous projects, I have also run my own company, which allowed me to delve into the business, management and leadership side of tech. 

What I enjoy the most about this work is to study each business and to proactively identify the areas where I can make the biggest impact. This could mean delivering profitable solutions, reducing costs or helping my co-workers work more efficiently.

This is what I strive to achieve as an IT specialist.`,
